## Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
### Linear Search
Linear search is a straightforward algorithm used to find a specific value within a list or array. It works by checking each element in the list sequentially until the desired value is found or the end of the list is reached. The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
### Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient algorithm used to find a specific value in a sorted list or array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half. This process is repeated until the value is found or the interval is empty. The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

## Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
| Algorithm      | Time Complexity |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Linear Search  | O(n)            |
| Binary Search  | O(log n)        |

## Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.
### When to Use Linear Search
Linear search is suitable for small or unsorted datasets where the overhead of sorting the data for binary search would not be justified. It is also useful when the dataset is small enough that the linear time complexity does not significantly impact performance.
### When to Use Binary Search
Binary search is ideal for larger datasets that are sorted. It is much more efficient than linear search for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity. If the dataset is sorted, binary search should always be preferred over linear search to minimize search time.
